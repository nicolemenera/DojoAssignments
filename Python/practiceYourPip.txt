pip list     this installed packages and editables. There are different commands you can use, and I believe they are used like this…
-o, —-outdated   (this will give you a list of outdated packages
-u, —-uptodate   (this will give you a list of uptodate packages
-e, —-editable   (editable)
and so forth.


Running pip install Django after you have already installed it will just let you know that this requirement has already been satisfied.

pip freeze outputs installed packages in requirements format

When I run pip freeze > requirements.txt (while in my Desktop) it just shows all the files that are in my desktop.

pip uninstall Django uninstalled Django.

Well clearly NOTHING happens when I put pip show Django, because YOU JUST HAD ME UNINSTALL IT. Now I have to re install it….

Now AFTER I reinstalled Django (because you made me uninstall it), when I type in pip show Django, it just tells me al about the version of Django I have downloaded.

pip search flask just searches for PyPi (the Python Package Index) who name or summary contains whatever you put in the command line next to it. Example: pip search flask.
